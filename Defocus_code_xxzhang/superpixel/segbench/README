(1) For the image and segmentation reading routines in the Dataset
directory to work, make sure you edit Dataset/bsdsRoot.m to point to
your local copy of the BSDS dataset.

(2) Run 'gmake install' from this directory to build everything.  You
should then probably put the lib/matlab directory in your MATLAB path.

(3) Read the Benchmark/README file.
